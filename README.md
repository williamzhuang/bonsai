Open Source Skill Tree Application for Android

The SkillTree Application is an application that helps users keep track of their progress in developing skills in any area. Users generate skill trees and vote on their favorite trees. Leaderboards can show progress and competition among friends. Additionally, the trees would be separated into categories such as fitness, knowledge, or practical skills and the like. 

The front page would be a dashboard showing your trees, progress statistics, etc.
